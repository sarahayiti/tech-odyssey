# 🌌 Tech Odyssey

Welcome to **Tech Odyssey** — my personal coding journey repo 🚀.  
Here, I’ll be documenting my daily challenges, progress, and projects as I grow from the basics (HTML/CSS) into a full-on techie.

## 📅 Daily Challenges
Each challenge lives inside the `challenges/` folder, organized by day:

- **Day 01:** Pretty UL (custom list styling with CSS) ✅
- **Day 02:** ...coming soon

## 🎯 Goals
- Stay consistent (daily challenges + FreeCodeCamp)  
- Build a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and beyond  
- Document my growth openly on GitHub  
- Land my first gig in tech and celebrate 🎉

## 📝 Notes
This repo is not about perfection,it’s about **progress**.  
Every commit = another step in my odyssey through tech.
